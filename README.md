## About

To be able to make decisions based on DGC instances, business rules have to be implemented.
This repository collects “various” relevant artifacts pertaining to business rules.


## Testing & Status

- If you found any problems, please create an [Issue](/../../issues).
- Please make sure to review the issues to see if any other members states found issues with your provided test data.
- Current status: _very_ much a Work-In-Progress. 


## Code organization

- [JavaScript “stuff”](./javascript): see [that README](./javascript/README.md) for pointers
- Prelimary implementation of the [rules](./rules) in the [JsonLogic](https://jsonlogic.com/) format.
  _Note:_ this has currently **no official status!**.
